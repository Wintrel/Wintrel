### `CURRENT DIRECTIVE`

> Architecting the core systems of the BLOOM simulation. My focus is on building a stable, scalable, and professional foundation for a world that will grow with its community.

<br>

### `ACTIVE SIMULATION`

</p>


> **BLOOM** is a fast-paced, movement-based survival game where you're trapped in a broken simulation. Use advanced parkour skills like wall-running, bhopping, sliding, and climbing to escape from Nextbots and uncover hidden secrets.

<br>

### `CORE PHILOSOPHY`

* **Design:** Build worlds that mean something.
* **Engineering:** Push the boundaries of what's possible.
* **Art:** Tell stories through every pixel and polygon.
